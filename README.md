# Weather Monitor Dashboard using Syncfusion MAUI Toolkit

This sample delves into building a Weather Monitoring Dashboard using the Syncfusion .NET MAUI Toolkit and MAUI Controls to deliver weather insights and demonstrate how these tools can be useful for understanding patterns and trends.

## Features
* **Visualizing Temperature Trends with Charts:** The SfCartesianChart is used to display temperature variations throughout the day. The actual temperature is represented through a SplineAreaSeries, while the “feels like” temperature is represented through a SplineSeries within an SfCartesianChart. These components offer an intuitive understanding of temperature patterns.
* **Wind Direction Compass:** The wind direction is visualized using the .NET MAUI SfRadialGauge control, which offers an engaging way to display wind movement. This example illustrates how such visualizations can be applied to real-world scenarios.
* **Visualizing Climate factors with RadialbarSeries:** To create a visually engaging and modern visualization of key weather metrics such as rain percentage, humidity, and dew chances, we utilize the RadialBarSeries in the MAUI Toolkit SfCircularChart.

### Output

## Troubleshooting

### Path Too Long Exception

If you are facing a "Path too long" exception when building this example project, close Visual Studio and rename the repository to a shorter name before building the project.
